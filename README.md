# AtliQ Grands Hospitality Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

AtliQ Grands, an imaginary hotel chain operating in multiple Indian cities, faces significant challenges from competitors. They are experiencing revenue losses and declining market share. To address this, the management has decided to leverage data analytics for informed decision-making.

This project aims to design and implement a data analysis solution that extracts valuable insights from AtliQ Grands’ booking database. The goal is to identify patterns, optimize revenue, and enhance customer experience.

### Key Learnings

1. **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)**
   - Real-time processing for transactions such as hotel bookings, cancellations, and payments. It’s the operational database used for day-to-day activities.

2. **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)**
   - Analyzing historical data for decision-making, involving complex queries and aggregations to gain insights.

3. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**
   - Processes involving extracting data from various sources (like CSV files), transforming it (cleaning, structuring), and loading it into a data warehouse.

4. **Data Warehouse**
   - A centralized repository that stores data from different sources, optimized for querying and reporting.

5. **Data Understanding**
   - **CSV Files:** Understanding the data stored in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files, which contain tabular data.
   - **Fact vs. Dimension Tables, Star vs. Snowflake Schema:**
     - **Fact Table:** Contains transactional data (e.g., bookings, revenue) and connects to dimension tables.
     - **Dimension Table:** Holds descriptive information (e.g., hotel details, customer profiles).
     - **Star Schema:** A data modeling technique where the fact table is at the center, connected to dimension tables.
     - **Snowflake Schema:** An extension of the star schema, where dimension tables are further normalized.

6. **Data Exploration**
   - Analyzing the data to discover patterns, trends, and anomalies. This step helps identify insights.

7. **Data Cleaning**
   - Preparing the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. Clean data ensures accurate analysis.

8. **Data Transformation**
   - Converting data into a suitable format for analysis. This may involve aggregating, joining, or reshaping data.

9. **Insights Generation**
   - Deriving actionable insights from the cleaned and transformed data. These insights guide decision-making.
